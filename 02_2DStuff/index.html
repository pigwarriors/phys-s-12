#Class 2: 2D design and cutting

<br>

##CAD:

</div>


CAD (computer-aided design) is a family of software that allows engineers, creators,
architects, etc to precisely digitally model objects. This week we learned the fundamentals
of CAD and did three things.

1. Used a tutorial to learn how to 2D Sketch

2. Created 2 household objects and put them in an assembly

3. Designed a press-fit object, 2D modeled, and laser cut it

<br>

####Tutorial:

This was the tutorial I used: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVFYrBClkPc">Fusion 360 Tutorial for Beginners - 1</a>.

I used Onshape to complete this tutorial as I am more comfortable with the program.

In the tutorial the instructor had you create 3 shapes using many different tools.

#####Drawing 1

<div class="smaller-image-1">
    ![Tutorial Drawing 1](./Images/Drawing1.png)
</div>

Note: For this shape, I had to add a construction line to constrain the drawing properly.
I think this is something to do with the fusion 360 vs Onshape programs

Tools Used: line, arc, dimension, construction

<br>

#####Drawing 2

<div class="smaller-image-1">
    ![Tutorial Drawing 2](./Images/Drawing2.png)
</div>

Tools Used: Circle, line, tangent, cotangent, construction, trim, dimension

<br>

#####Drawing 3

<div class="smaller-image-1">
    ![Tutorial Drawing 3](./Images/Drawing3.png)
</div>

Tools Used: Ellipse, dimension

<br>

###House Hold objects:

Another assignment we had this week was to use calipers to measure and then
model household objects. I chose to model a pencil and a USB stick.

<br>

####Pencil

#####1. Get the Dimensions of the pencil

    ![Pencil Dimentions](./Images/PencilDimentions.png)
</div>

<br>

#####2. Model

#####3. Color

####USB Drive

#####1. Get Dimensions

<br>

#####2. Model

</div>

<br>

#####3. Color

</div>

<br>

####Importing Assets:
<br>

Another thing that we could do was import assets to add to our final assembly

I imported 2 assets:
Laptop (link: https://grabcad.com/library/a-laptop-1)
Desk (link: https://grabcad.com/library/adjustable-desk-8)

<br>

####Assembily:

I created a simple desk setup for my assembly

The colored Objects are the ones I modeled
<br>

##2D Cutting:

Our project in this class was to create a press-fit design. This could be anything from an abstract sculpture to a sophisticated box. It just had to meet a few criteria.

No adhesives
Design using CAD and laser cut

###Tolorence Test:

For my project, I knew that I would need to know what tolerances to use so everything would fit together snugly. I decided to 2D model a test for all the different press fit connections I could use.

<div class="smaller-image-1">
    ![TEstPeiceDrawing](./Images/TestPeiceDrawing.png)
</div>

<br>

After I printed out the piece I wrote notes on one of the pieces and used this to better my future designs.

</div>

<br>

###AbstractSculpture:

<br>
After testing I decided that I wanted to create an Abstract Sculpture

I looked at some previous designs for inspiration like this one, and then I decided on a shape.

<div class="smaller-image-1">
    ![CadOf1Shape](./Images/cutOut.png)
</div>

<br>

I knew that I would have to have many of these pieces so I also created a sketch with many of these shapes.

<div class="smaller-image-1">
    ![CadOfManyShape](./Images/AllCutOuts.png)
</div>

<br>

I then laser cut out all the shapes on a 

<div class="smaller-image-1">
    ![LazerCutting](./Images/AllCutOuts.png)
</div>

<br>

Then I assembled my shapes into a 3D object!
