        <h1>Class 2: 2D design and cutting</h1>

        <h2>2D Cutting:</h2>

        <p>
            Our project in this class was to create a press-fit design. This could be anything 
            from an abstract sculpture to a sophisticated box. It just had to meet a few criteria.

            No adhesives
    
            Design using CAD and laser cut
        </p>

        <h2>Tolorence Test:</h2>

        <p>
            For my project, I knew that I would need to know what tolerances to use so everything would 
            fit together snugly. I decided to 2D model a test for all the different press fit connections I could use.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            After I printed out the piece I wrote notes on one of the pieces and used this to better my future designs.

        </p>

        <br>
        
        <h2>Abstract Sculpture:</h2>

        <p>
            After testing I decided that I wanted to create an Abstract Sculpture.
            <br>
            I looked at some previous designs for inspiration like this one, and then I decided on a shape.
        </p>

        <h2>Process:</h2>

        <img src="Images/cutOut.png" alt="Cad Of 1 shape" class="imgCenter">

        <br>

        <p> 
            I knew that I would have to have many of these pieces so I also created a sketch with many of these shapes.
        </p>
       
        <img src="Images/AllCutOuts.png" alt="Cad Of Many Shapes" class="imgCenter">

        <br>

        <p>
            I then laser cut out all the shapes. 
        </p>

        <img src="Images/CuttingOut.JPG" alt="Lazer Cutting" class="imgCenter">

        <br>

        Then I assembled my shapes into a 3D object!

        <h2>Final Sculpture: </h2>

        <h1>Intro To Cad: </h1>

        <img src="Images/CadGraphic.png" alt="cad programs graphic" class="imgCenter">

        <p style="font-size: larger;">
            CAD (computer-aided design) is a family of software that allows engineers, creators,
            architects, etc to precisely digitally model objects. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This week we learned the fundamentals
            of CAD and did three things.
        </p>
        <ul style="font-size: large;">
            <li>Used a tutorial to learn how to 2D Sketch</li>
            <li>Created 2 household objects and put them in an assembly</li>
            <li>Designed a press-fit object, 2D modeled, and laser cut it</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h2>Tutorial: </h2>

        This was the tutorial I used: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVFYrBClkPc">Fusion 360 Tutorial for Beginners - 1</a>.
        <br>
        I used Onshape to complete this tutorial as I am more comfortable with the program.
        <br>
        In the tutorial the instructor had you create 3 shapes using many different tools.

        <h3>Drawing 1: </h3>
        <img src="Images/Drawing1.png" alt="Tutorial drawing 1" class="imgCenter">
        <div class="smaller-image-1">
            ![Tutorial Drawing 1](./Images/Drawing1.png)
        </div>

        Note: For this shape, I had to add a construction line to constrain the drawing properly.
        I think this is something to do with the fusion 360 vs Onshape programs

        Tools Used: line, arc, dimension, construction

        <br>

        #####Drawing 2

        <div class="smaller-image-1">
            ![Tutorial Drawing 2](./Images/Drawing2.png)
        </div>

        Tools Used: Circle, line, tangent, cotangent, construction, trim, dimension

        <br>

        #####Drawing 3

        <div class="smaller-image-1">
            ![Tutorial Drawing 3](./Images/Drawing3.png)
        </div>

        Tools Used: Ellipse, dimension

        <br>

        ###House Hold objects:

        Another assignment we had this week was to use calipers to measure and then
        model household objects. I chose to model a pencil and a USB stick.

        <br>

        ####Pencil

        #####1. Get the Dimensions of the pencil

        <div class="smaller-image-1">
            ![Pencil Dimentions](./Images/PencilDimentions.png)
        </div>

        <br>

        #####2. Model

        <div class="smaller-image-1">
            ![ModelingPencil](./Images/PencilBland.png)
        </div>

        #####3. Color

        <div class="smaller-image-1">
            ![Final Pencil Model](./Images/PencilColored.png)
        </div>

        ####USB Drive

        #####1. Get Dimensions
            
        <div class="smaller-image-1">
            ![USB Dimentions Graphic](./Images/USBDimentions.png)
        </div>

        <br>

        #####2. Model

        <div class="smaller-image-1">
            ![USB Model](./Images/USBBland.png)
        </div>

        <br>

        #####3. Color

        <div class="smaller-image-1">
            ![USB Final Model](./Images/USBColored.png)
        </div>

        <br>

        ####Importing Assets:
        <br>

        Another thing that we could do was import assets to add to our final assembly

        I imported 2 assets:
        Laptop (link: https://grabcad.com/library/a-laptop-1)
        Desk (link: https://grabcad.com/library/adjustable-desk-8)

        <br>

        ####Assembily:

        I created a simple desk setup for my assembly

        The colored Objects are the ones I modeled
        <br>

        <div class="smaller-image-1">
            ![Desk Assembily](./Images/DeskAssym.png)
        </div>
