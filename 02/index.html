        <h2>2D Cutting:</h2>

        <p>
            Our project in this class was to create a press-fit design. This could be anything 
            from an abstract sculpture to a sophisticated box. It just had to meet a few criteria.

            No adhesives
    
            Design using CAD and laser cut
        </p>

        <h2>Tolerance Test:</h2>

        <p>
            For my project, I knew that I would need to know what tolerances to use so everything would 
            fit together snugly. I decided to 2D model a test for all the different press fit connections I could use.
        </p>
        
        

        <img src="Images/TestPeiceDrawing.png" alt="Cad of Test" class="imgCenter">

        <br>

        <p>
            After I printed out the piece I wrote notes on one of the pieces and used this to better my future designs.

        </p>

        <br>
        
        <h2>Abstract Sculpture:</h2>

        <p>
            After testing I decided that I wanted to create an Abstract Sculpture.
            <br>
            I looked at some previous designs for inspiration like this one, and then I decided on a shape.
        </p>

        <h2>Process:</h2>

        <img src="Images/cutOut.png" alt="Cad Of 1 shape" class="imgCenter">

        <br>

        <p> 
            I knew that I would have to have many of these pieces so I also created a sketch with many of these shapes.
        </p>
       
        <img src="Images/AllCutOuts.png" alt="Cad Of Many Shapes" class="imgCenter">

        <br>

        <p>
            I then laser cut out all the shapes. 
        </p>

        <img src="Images/CuttingOut.JPG" alt="Laser Cutting" class="imgCenter">

        <br>

        Then I assembled my shapes into a 3D object!

        <h2>Final Sculpture: </h2>

        <br>

        <h1>Intro To Cad: </h1>

        <img src="Images/CadGraphic.png" alt="cad programs graphic" class="imgCenter">

        <p style="font-size: larger;">
            CAD (computer-aided design) is a family of software that allows engineers, creators,
            architects, etc to precisely digitally model objects. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This week we learned the fundamentals
            of CAD and did three things.
        </p>
        <ul style="font-size: large;">
            <li>Used a tutorial to learn how to 2D Sketch</li>
            <li>Created 2 household objects and put them in an assembly</li>
            <li>Designed a press-fit object, 2D modeled, and laser cut it</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h2>Tutorial: </h2>

        <p>
            This was the tutorial I used: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVFYrBClkPc">Fusion 360 Tutorial for Beginners - 1</a>.
            <br>
            I used Onshape to complete this tutorial as I am more comfortable with the program.
            <br>
            In the tutorial the instructor had you create 3 shapes using many different tools.
        </p>
        

        <h3>Drawing 1: </h3>
        <img src="Images/Drawing1.png" alt="Tutorial drawing 1" class="imgCenter">
        <p>
            <strong>Note: </strong>For this shape, I had to add a construction line to constrain the drawing properly.

            I think this is something to do with the fusion 360 vs Onshape programs
            <br>
            <strong>Tools Used:</strong> line, arc, dimension, construction
        </p>
        

        <br>

        <h3>Drawing 2: </h3>

        <img src="Images/Drawing2.png" alt="Tutorial Drawing 2" class="imgCenter">

        <p>
            <strong>Tools Used:</strong> Circle, line, tangent, cotangent, construction, trim, dimension
        </p>
       

        <br>

        <h3>Drawing 3: </h3>

        <img src="Images/Drawing3.png" alt="Tutorial Drawing 3" class="imgCenter">

        <p>
            <strong>Tools Used:</strong> Ellipse, dimension
        </p>

        

        <br>

        <h2>House Hold objects:</h2>

        <p>
            Another assignment we had this week was to use calipers to measure and then
            model household objects. I chose to model a pencil and a USB stick.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Pencil:</h2>

        <h3>1. Get the Dimensions of the pencil</h3>

        <br>

        <h3>2. Model</h3>

        <h3>3. Color</h3>

        <img src="Images/PencilColored.png" alt="Pencil with Colors" class="imgCenter">

        <h2>USB Drive</h2>

        <h3>1. Get Dimensions</h3>
            
        <img src="Images/USBDimentions.png" alt="USB measurements" class="imgCenter">

        <br>

        <h3>2. Model</h3>

        <img src="Images/USBBland.png" alt="USB Model" class="imgCenter">

        <br>

        <h3>3. Color</h3>

        <img src="Images/USBColored.png" alt="USB Colored" class="imgCenter">
        <br>

        <h2>Importing Assets:</h2>

        <p>
            Another thing that we could do was import assets to add to our final assembly
            I imported 2 assets:
            <br>
            <br>
            Laptop: <a href="https://grabcad.com/library/a-laptop-1">https://grabcad.com/library/a-laptop-1</a>
            <br>
            Desk: <a href="https://grabcad.com/library/adjustable-desk-8">https://grabcad.com/library/adjustable-desk-8</a>
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Assembly:</h2>

        <p>
            I created a simple desk setup for my assembly.
            The colored Objects are the ones I modeled.
            <br>
